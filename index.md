## Summary

As an Information Systems graduate with a strong interest in mobile intelligent systems and agentic AI, I aim to explore how AI-driven decision support can enhance early-stage product development and human–AI collaboration. Over the past years, I have worked as a mobile developer, UI/UX designer, and CTO of an AI-driven startup, allowing me to integrate technical development with user-centered design and real product execution. My experience building AI-enhanced applications and leading cross-functional teams has strengthened my interest in research on mobile AI agents, product reasoning systems, and Human–AI interaction. I am eager to pursue graduate study to deepen my technical foundations and contribute to research that bridges intelligent systems with real-world impact.
